# **Turtle Race** 🐢
This is a basic turtle racing game created with Python and Turtle.

### **Description**
The program allows the user to choose a turtle by its colour and then simulates a race between 6 turtles of different colours. The turtle that reaches the finish line first is the winner.
The user can bet at the start on the colour of the turtle he thinks will win. At the end of the race a message is printed indicating whether the user won or lost his bet.
